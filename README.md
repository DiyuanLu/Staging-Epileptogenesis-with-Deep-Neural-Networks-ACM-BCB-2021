# Joint repository of 3 papers on deep neural networks with EEG for the early diagnosis of epilepsy.

1. A deep residual neural network based framework for epileptogenesis detection in a rodent model with single-channel EEG recordings. in the parameters yaml file, if_spectrum is set to be True, then the corresponding model name need to be changed and the filter kernel need to use 2-d image-based filters.
2. Towards Early Diagnosis of Epilepsy from EEG Data
3. Staging Epileptogenesis with Deep Neural Networks
4. 
Joint repo. for epileptogenesis detection with deep neural networks.
This is a merged repo for our papers on deep neural networks for the early diagnosis of epilepsy.
