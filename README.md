# Code for the paper Staging Epileptogenesis with Deep Neural Networks, published in Proceedings of the 11th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics

The architecture was inspired by the ResNet developed for [Cardiologist-level arrhythmia detection and classification in ambulatory electrocardiograms using a deep neural network](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0268-3?source=techstories.org
)
